Arithmetic Operators

The Java programming language supports various arithmetic operators for all floating-point and integer numbers. 
These operators are + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), and % (modulo). 
The following table summarizes the binary arithmetic operations in the Java programming language.

1. Addition(+): This operator is a binary operator and is used to add two operands.
Syntax: num1 + num2
Example:
    num1 = 10, num2 = 20
    sum = num1 + num2 = 30


2. Subtraction(-): This operator is a binary operator and is used to subtract two operands.

Syntax: num1 - num2
Example:
    num1 = 20, num2 = 10
    sub = num1 - num2 = 10


3. Multiplication(*): This operator is a binary operator and is used to multiply two operands.

Syntax:num1 * num2
Example:
    num1 = 20, num2 = 10
    mult = num1 * num2 = 200


4. Division(/): This is a binary operator that is used to divide the first operand(dividend) by the second operand(divisor) 
                and give the quotient as a result.

Syntax:num1 / num2
Example:
    num1 = 20, num2 = 10
    div = num1 / num2 = 2


5. Modulus(%): This is a binary operator that is used to return the remainder when the first operand(dividend) is divided 
                by the second operand(divisor).

Syntax:num1 % num2
Example:
    num1 = 5, num2 = 2
    mod = num1 % num2 = 1
